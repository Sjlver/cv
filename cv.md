What distinguishes me: The will to never stop learning


Research interests
------------------

My mission is to build automated software analysis tools that help
developers build better programs with ease. I focus on developing
techniques applicable to real-world software systems.


Education
---------

### 2011 – present: PhD in Computer Science

[dslab.epfl.ch](http://dslab.epfl.ch/)

Dependable Systems Lab, EPFL, Lausanne\
Under the direction of Prof. George Candea

### 2008 – 2011: Master in communication systems

[ssc.epfl.ch/master](http://ssc.epfl.ch/master)

Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne\
Grade point average: 5.87 out of 6

### 2005 – 2008: Bachelor in communication systems

[ssc.epfl.ch/bachelor](http://ssc.epfl.ch/bachelor)

Two years at EPFL, Lausanne, and one year at NTU, Singapore\
Grade point average: 5.77 out of 6


Projects
--------

### ASAP

[dslab.epfl.ch/proj/asap](http://dslab.epfl.ch/proj/asap)

ASAP is an automated approach and tool to instrument programs subject to
performance constraints. It combines profiling and compiler techniques to
generate programs that are as safe as possible, while satisfying the user's
overhead budget.

### <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-Overify</span>

[dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf](http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf)

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-Overify</span> is a compiler flag that
speeds up software verification by up to 95×. It is based on the insight that
compiling for verification requires different optimizations than compiling for
fast execution, and introduces a new cost model to generate code that is
adapted to the need of verification tools.


Work experience
---------------

### Sept. 2010 to March 2011: Master Thesis at Open Systems

[www.open.ch](http://www.open.ch/)

Performance measurement of VPN links and automatic detection of performance
degradation. This project combined practical application of Perl, C and Unix
with engineering and a solid mathematical foundation. The thesis was awarded
the maximum grade and was important for upcoming network monitoring efforts at
Open Systems.

### Feb. to Aug. 2009: Internship at MadeinLocal

[www.madeinlocal.com](http://www.madeinlocal.com/)

Web development using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript for MadeinLocal.com, the
next generation local guide powered by social networking. In a dynamic start-up
team, I assumed responsibility for developing business logic and connections to
external sites such as Facebook.

### June to Sept. 2008: Internship at Bucher+Suter

[www.bucher-suter.com](http://www.bucher-suter.com/)

Internship as a software developer at Bucher+Suter. Various projects using Java, C++ and PHP in a Cisco Contact Center environment.
