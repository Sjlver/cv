Research Interests
------------------

My mission is to create automated program analysis techniques that help
developers construct better software with ease. I prototype these techniques
into tools and evaluate them on real-world software systems.

My work lies at the intersection of verification, programming languages, and
operating systems. It is currently focused on ASAP, a technique to enforce
security properties (e.g., the absence of buffer overflows) at runtime with
high performance.

Education
---------

### PhD in Computer Science, EPFL: 2011 – present 

[dslab.epfl.ch](http://dslab.epfl.ch/)
Dependable Systems Lab, EPFL, Lausanne\
Under the direction of Prof. George Candea

### Master in Communication Systems, EPFL: 2008 - 2011

[ssc.epfl.ch/master](http://ssc.epfl.ch/master)
School of Computer and Communication Systems, EPFL, Lausanne\
Specialization in Internet Computing. Master thesis in industry, on automatic
detection of bad performance in VPN tunnels.

### Bachelor in Communication Systems, EPFL: 2005 - 2008

[ssc.epfl.ch/bachelor](http://ssc.epfl.ch/bachelor)
Two years at EPFL, Lausanne, and one year at NTU, Singapore


Projects
--------

### ASAP

[dslab.epfl.ch/proj/asap](http://dslab.epfl.ch/proj/asap)
ASAP is an automated approach and tool to instrument programs subject to
performance constraints. It combines profiling and compiler techniques to
generate programs that are as safe as possible, while satisfying the user's
overhead budget.

### <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-Overify</span>

[dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf](http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf)
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-Overify</span> is a compiler flag that
speeds up software verification by up to 95×. It is based on the insight that
compiling for verification requires different optimizations than compiling for
fast execution, and introduces a new cost model to generate code that is
adapted to the need of verification tools.


Publications
------------

### ASAP: High Security at Low Overhead

[dslab.epfl.ch/proj/asap](http://dslab.epfl.ch/proj/asap)
Jonas Wagner, Volodymyr Kuznetsov, Johannes Kinder, Azqa Nadeem, and George Candea\
Poster presented at the 11^th^ USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI Poster), 2014

### <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-Overify</span>: Optimizing Programs for Fast Verification

[dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf](http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf)
Jonas Wagner, Volodymyr Kuznetsov, and George Candea\
14^th^ Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HotOS), 2013


Work experience
---------------

### Master Thesis at Open Systems: Sept. 2010 to March 2011

[www.open.ch](http://www.open.ch/)
Performance measurement of VPN links and automatic detection of performance
degradation. This project combined practical application of Perl, C and Unix
with engineering and a solid mathematical foundation. The thesis was awarded
the maximum grade and was important for upcoming network monitoring efforts at
Open Systems.

### Internship at MadeinLocal: Feb. to Aug. 2009

[www.madeinlocal.com](http://www.madeinlocal.com/)
Web development for MadeinLocal.com, the next generation local guide powered by
social networking. In a dynamic start-up team, I assumed responsibility for
developing business logic in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, and connections to
external sites such as Facebook.

### Internship at Bucher+Suter: June to Sept. 2008

[www.bucher-suter.com](http://www.bucher-suter.com/)
I worked as a software developer on various projects using Java, C++ and PHP in
a Cisco Contact Center environment.
