Research Interests
------------------

My mission is to create automated program analysis and transformation techniques
that help developers construct better software with ease. I prototype these
techniques into tools and evaluate them on real-world software systems.

My work lies at the intersection of verification, programming languages, and
operating systems. It recognizes that program transformations are always
trade-offs. They affect a program's speed, security, ease of verification, and
reliability. Tools such as ASAP give developers an automated and precise way to
obtain the most favorable trade-off for their particular use-case.


Education
---------

### PhD in Computer Science, EPFL: 2011 – present 

[dslab.epfl.ch](http://dslab.epfl.ch/)
Dependable Systems Lab, EPFL, Lausanne\
Under the direction of Prof. George Candea\
Expected graduation in March 2017

### Master in Communication Systems, EPFL: 2008 - 2011

[ssc.epfl.ch/master](http://ssc.epfl.ch/master)
School of Computer and Communication Systems, EPFL, Lausanne\
Specialization in Internet Computing. Master thesis in industry, on automatic
detection of bad performance in VPN tunnels.

### Bachelor in Communication Systems, EPFL: 2005 - 2008

[ssc.epfl.ch/bachelor](http://ssc.epfl.ch/bachelor)
Two years at EPFL, Lausanne, and one year at NTU, Singapore


Publications
------------

### ASAP: High System-Code Security with Low Overhead

[dslab.epfl.ch/proj/asap](http://dslab.epfl.ch/proj/asap)
Jonas Wagner, Volodymyr Kuznetsov, George Candea, and Johannes Kinder\
36^th^ IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P), 2015

ASAP is an automated approach and tool to instrument programs subject to
performance constraints. It combines profiling and compiler techniques to
generate programs that are as safe as possible, while satisfying the user's
overhead budget.

### <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-Overify</span>: Optimizing Programs for Fast Verification

[dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf](http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf)
Jonas Wagner, Volodymyr Kuznetsov, and George Candea\
14^th^ Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HotOS), 2013

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-Overify</span> is a compiler flag that
speeds up software verification by up to 95×. It is based on the insight that
compiling for verification requires different optimizations than compiling for
fast execution, and introduces a new cost model to generate code that is
adapted to the need of verification tools.


Work experience
---------------

### Cyber Grand Challenge Finalist: February to August 2016

[www.cybergrandchallenge.com](https://www.cybergrandchallenge.com/)
I joined team CodeJitsu at UC Berkeley, led by Prof. Dawn Song, to participate
in DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge. In this first ever all-machine hacking
tournament, I worked on a system to automatically disassemble, analyze and
instrument X86 binaries. Instrumentation protects the binaries against software
vulnerabilities, while satisfying strict limits on memory consumption and
execution time overhead. Team CodeJitsu ranked fifth out of seven finalists.

### Internship at Google: May to August 2015

[www.google.com](https://www.google.com/)
I built tools to systematically scan all Android apps for security
vulnerabilities. The project used program analysis and abstract interpretation
techniques in a distributed cloud setup. It is now running in production at
Google and warns app developers whenever a new vulnerability is detected.

### Master Thesis at Open Systems: Sept. 2010 to March 2011

[www.open.ch](https://www.open.ch/)
Performance measurement of VPN links and automatic detection of performance
degradation. This project combined practical application of Perl, C and Unix
with engineering and a solid mathematical foundation. The thesis was awarded
the maximum grade and was important for upcoming network monitoring efforts at
Open Systems.

### Internship at MadeinLocal: Feb. to Aug. 2009

[www.madeinlocal.com](http://www.madeinlocal.com/)
Web development for MadeinLocal.com, the next generation local guide powered by
social networking. In a dynamic start-up team, I assumed responsibility for
developing business logic in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, and connections to
external sites such as Facebook.
