Jonas Wagner's Curriculum Vitae
===============================

My attempt at building a CV using modern web technologies.

To build:

- Install [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
- `make`
- `open cv.html`
- Export as PDF

I've tested the process using Chrome on Mac. The result is quite satisfying;
remaining problems are documented in [the issues](https://github.com/Sjlver/cv/issues).

Feedback is very welcome!
